## A repo for r2anki-decks
Writing good Anki-cards is quite a bit of work. But it scales quite well. So take a look at the r2anki-notebooks in this repo, use and extend them as you see fit. Please also consider contributing your own Anki-cards via a pull-request.

This is a repo accompaning the [r2anki-package](https://github.com/henningsway/r2anki).

You can clone the repo or download the files, export them to your Anki-collection via `r2anki::r2anki()` and give it a try.

Feedback is very welcome! :)
